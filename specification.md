# **Amusement Park Digital Payment and Ticketing System**

## **Overview**

This project replaces the traditional physical ticketing and payment system of an amusement park with a **web-based digital ticketing solution**. The system allows park visitors to purchase **entry and ride tickets online**, receive **QR-coded virtual tickets**, and enables smooth validation by park employees.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Entry Ticketing System**

- Visitors can **purchase entry tickets online** via the amusement park‚Äôs website.
- **On-site Ticket Purchase:** Visitors can scan a **QR code at the park gate** to access the entry ticket purchase page.
- A visitor can **purchase tickets for multiple people** in one transaction.
- Upon successful purchase, visitors receive a **virtual ticket (PDF via email)** containing:
  - QR code for verification
  - Booking details (name, number of people, date, time slot)
- Park employees scan the QR code at the entrance for validation.

#### **Entry Ticket Pricing & Cancellation Policy**

### **2. Ride Ticketing System**

- Visitors can buy ride tickets **through the website** or **by scanning a QR code at each ride location**.
